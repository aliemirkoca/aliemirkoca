### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Ali Emir

I am an **Industrial Engineering Student** with a strong passion for software development and data-driven systems. My goal is to bridge the gap between complex data analysis and robust application development, using **Python** for analysis and modeling, and **C# / .NET** for creating scalable, real-world applications.
